			The adventure seems to be going well so far! You know your limits and avoided a fight you didn't think you could win, though one day you may come back to make sure the world is safe.
		</p>
		<p>
			You continue your adventure to the outside world, following a road to a village called "Townton".
		</p>

		<p>
			There, you meet a kind old man.

		<pre class="pt-3 border w-50 mx-auto my-3">
Have you seen the town rat, Marshall? He's gone missing.
Oh, also, if you know anything, could you go let my son know? He'd just gone off to find Marshall.
He's got a skin condition that makes him look ghoulish.
		</pre>

		<p>
			The old man has asked for your help, but it seems that you may have been mistaken at the start of your adventure... how shall you respond?
